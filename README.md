# OpenAI Discord Bot

This repo contains a simple Discord bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to act as a chatbot while assuming a character.
You can modify the code to use GPT-4 if you have access to it, but I have found that the turbo model is more than sufficient for this task.

## Setup

1. Create a Discord bot and invite it to your server. You can find a guide [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html). Make sure to enable the `Message Content` and `Server Members` intents.
2. Create an OpenAI API key for the bot. You can find the API page [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following lines:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openai api key>
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<your discord bot token>
```

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `python bot.py` to start the bot.

## Features

- Summon the bot by mentioning it
- Follows a conversation via replies
- Each user has their own self-contained conversation
- User can reset the conversation by typing `forget me`

## Usage

The bot will automatically join the server and start listening for messages. To start a conversation, simply mention the bot then type your message. The bot will respond with a message that is generated by the API. You can then reply to the bot's message and the conversation will continue.

To make the bot reset the conversation, simply mention the bot and type `forget me`.

For example: `@GPTbot forget me`

## Modification

You can modify the code to use a different model or to change the character that the bot is acting as. To change the model, simply change the `system_model` variable in `bot.py` to the name of the model you want to use (e.g. `gpt-4`).

To change the character, modify the `system_prompt` variable in `bot.py` to the name of the character you want the bot to act as.
